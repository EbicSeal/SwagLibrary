# Compatibility
Which versions SwagLibrary works on, keep in mind that i will not update the library just to support an older version.
## Supported Teardown Versions

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.5.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| <1.4.x  | ❓                 |

Why dont i support 1.4.x and lower?

i simply dont feel like switching versions each time i make a change, it costs alot of time and effort and i dont play on 1.4 since the lack of support and lack of new mod support. so i have no clue if it works on 1.4.x or lower
